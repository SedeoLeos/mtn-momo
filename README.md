## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install momo-api.

```bash
`npm i mtn-momo-api --save`
```

Usage
Here's an example of how you can use the Momo API integration library in your project:

```bash
`
const { Controller } = require('momo-api');

async function makeRequest() {
  // Instantiate the Controller class with your credentials
  const app = new Controller({
    callbackHost: "https://webhook.site/318e088e-2f48-4ad4-8974-7615436d637a",
    userSecret: "YOUR_USER_SECRET",
    userId: "YOUR_USER_ID",
    primaryKey: "YOUR_PRIMARY_KEY"
  });

  // Make a request to pay
  try {
    const response = await app.requestToPay(
      "150",
      "EUR",
      "txt_011",
      "MSISDN",
      "256784771634",
      "testing",
      "testing"
    );

    console.log("Response:", response);

    // Get transaction status
    const status = await app.getTransactionStatus(response.referenceId);

    console.log("Transaction Status:", status);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  }
}

makeRequest();
`
```

Replace "YOUR_USER_SECRET", "YOUR_USER_ID", and "YOUR_PRIMARY_KEY" with your own Momo API credentials.
